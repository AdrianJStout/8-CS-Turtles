/I feel like we're going in circles!/

- Let's learn about circles!

- The Turtle library has a built-in function for making a circle!
- We can call this function by typing turtle.circle()
- Circles are a very useful tool!
- Look at the example below for more tips on how to draw circles

** Try It

/Think it, Trinket!/

#+END_HTML

- Try editing the code to draw another smaller circle underneath (75)
- Remember which direction to face to draw the circle downwards!
- Try drawing another small circle in the middle of the bigger ones
- Remember to use penup() and pendown() to move without drawing a line!

** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:

- Now that you've mastered that, how about using this to draw some faces!
- See if you can create a bear face like the one I created below! 
- Remember to use the: 

1. Circle function (with radius and extent)
2. Triangle function that you made in previous lessons
3. The turtle.penup() and turtle.pendown() functions

- Tip: Create a new function called DrawABear(): and put the code in there!

- Great! Now we can add some detail!
- Try adding pupils and an inner part to the bear's ears
- Remember to use a different colour!
