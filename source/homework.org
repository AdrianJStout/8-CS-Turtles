/I feel like we're going in circles!/

- Let's learn about circles!

- The Turtle library has a built-in function for making a circle!
- We can call this function by typing turtle.circle()
- Circles are a very useful tool!
- Look at the example below for more tips on how to draw circles

** Try It

:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try

/Think it, Trinket!/

- Try editing the code to draw another smaller circle underneath (75)
- Remember which direction to face to draw it down
- Try drawing another small circle in the middle of the bigger ones
- Remember to use penup() and pendown() to move without drawing a line!
*** Your homework:
- The code below gives you some code to draw one half circle
- You need to define a function called halfMoon()
- You then need to call the halfMoon function in a loop to create the following pattern.

* Homework 3 - Bearly work:

** Code It

:END:

- Now that you've mastered the circle function in the previous homework, how about using this to draw some faces!
- See if you can create a bear face like the one I created below! 
- Remember to use the: 
1. Circle function (with radius and extent)
2. Triangle function that you made in previous lessons
3. The turtle.penup() and turtle.pendown() functions

- Tip: Create a new function called DrawABear(): and put the code in there!

- Great! Now we can add some detail!
- Try adding pupils and an inner part to the bear's ears
- Remember to use a different colour!
